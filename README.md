# About 
Microsoft Cloud Workshops are the closest thing to building your own Azure solution. Experts will guide attendees through a full end-to-end solution hack lab.

## Two-Day IoT Cloud Workshop
The goal of this workshop is to develop a POC-quality IoT solution that includes IoT on the edge, device management, telemetry ingestion, hot/cold/warm path processing and reporting.

We begin with a short, informal Azure IoT briefing designed to explain key concepts and the latest announcement of the Azure IoT Suite and services.  
 
This will be followed by a hands-on lab session where you will learn how to implement an end-to-end solution simulating high velocity data emitted from smart meters and analysed in Azure. You will implement a lambda architecture, filtering a subset of the telemetry data for real-time visualization on the hot path, and storing all of the data in long-term cloud storage for the cold path. 

### Download Hands-on Lab (HOL)
Please [download](https://github.com/faister/msiotcloudworkshopau/blob/master/doc/hands-on%20lab%20step-by%20step%20-%20internet%20of%20things%20-%202018-03-v1.1.pdf) the HOL document.

If you are already comfortable with this HOL, you can proceed to the hack lab. 

## Hack Labs
During the hack lab, you can work individually or in your chosen group on any of the following scenarios: 

* Extend the Azure IoT Remote Monitoring or [Connected Factory preconfigured solutions](https://github.com/faister/connectedfactory) to connect to your own IoT assets
* Extend a solution from a local Azure IoT solution partner who is co-delivering this workshop with Microsoft
* [Build custom Azure IoT Edge modules](https://github.com/faister/iot-workshop) to connect a sensor like TI Sensor Tag and perform  edge processing 
* Connect to process control systems and [publish OPC nodes/PLC tags to IoT Hub](https://github.com/faister/connectedfactory/blob/master/README.md#opc-ua-integration) using OPC UA Publisher on the edge
* Bring-your-own-IoT-scenario and we will try our best to guide how you build it using Azure IoT services

> Please note: Workshop content presumes a 200 to 300-level of architectural expertise of infrastructure and solutions design in this domain (even if on another platform). We suggest attendees take the Microsoft Azure Essentials course as a prerequisite if unfamiliar with Azure. 

> Prerequisite: You will use your own Azure subscription or you can create your Azure free account prior to the workshop.
